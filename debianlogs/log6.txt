try #debian-mentors
so perhaps try installing it with debootstrap and bpo kernel
Echoz: yeah centos probably has the 2.6 kernel
have you checked if system stops responding completely after that?
are you sure it's not screensaver killing it? tried to keep it alive by moving the mouse or whatever?
dozer: I mean before it goes off
dozer: up to you, it was just a wild idea
so it's probably not blanking then
as in https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Remote
why would you ssh to live environment?
Echoz: yeah but the idea is to start sshd by the installer, that's what network-console preseed setting does and then one can ssh to the dell system from another computer
and install via that, assuming it's not a hard lock or whatever
Echoz: ahh sorry I get it now, yes it would be easier to configure using live that way
Ouroboros: man page says modprobe.blacklist=<module>
man modprobe
it is
judd kernels
please don't do that, we won't help with it either
how exactly do you think ubuntu deb will help then?
if you don't install them, then yes
omi: do debian kernels have relevant config options enabled?
omi: described in filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt
but I'll have to go now (should be CONFIG_IP_PNP* or somesuch)
