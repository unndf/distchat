my audio isent working, and i cant figure out why, iv checked synaptic and i should have what i need but i cant hear a thing
oh.. "audio software included, volume control not included.." guess i dident look to closely at the fine print that came with my debian ISO
why is there 2 software packages for audio? why not just have one package that has everything you need?
