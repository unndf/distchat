<desert>    my audio isen't working, and i can't figure out why, iv checked synaptic and i should have what i need but i can't hear a thing
<desert>    oh.. "audio software included, volume control not included.." guess i diden't look to closely at the fine print that came with my debian ISO
<desert>    why is there 2 software packages for audio? why not just have one package that has everything you need?
