Hello, I'm trying to make debian boot from iscsi root. It works when I manually add ISCSI target AND manually specify the machine's IP in the kernel boot command. BUT dhcp doesn't work from the kernel when doing ip=dhcp. YES, DHCP server works as it gives it lease twice to do pxe booting (and other hosts dhcp fine too) Any ideas why ip=dhcp just doen'st do anything? DHCPD log says that it offered the lease as before, but
kernel doesn't do anything with it.

This is useful for installing firmware for network cards and such
you need AMD driver.

note that it may have issues with gnome they say.
yeah I had fked up monitor, so AMD driver didn't work out of the box right away. but NVIDa proprietary I never had issues.
but AMD nice cards :D
Can anyone help with my kernel ip=dhcp issue?
After several iterations, IP Config: No response after __ seconds
dhcpd log says that the lease was offered.
jm_ what do you mean 'relevant'?
jm_ everything works provided I specify the IP manually in the kernel parameter. But that's one thing I would rather not do to keep the image generic. I want to be able to boot multiple hosts (and them get IP address as needed through dhcp settings rather than doing it)
