<nate>  Worth noting I believe it adjusts time based on your own system
<nate>  Have you checked to make sure -your- system isn't out of sync?
<nate>  Oh nevermind DrJ is saying the same thing
<nate>  I thought he was saying it looked normal for him
<nate>  Judging from the fact that DrJ's time states 3:21PM to me, I'm guessing the forum is set to a GMT-4 for some reason
<nate>  either that or it handled DST poorly
<nate>  Or apparently it handles no timezones properly, the timezone dropdown in the board settings is blank
<nate>  lol
<nate>  mcintosh: Still looks broke to me, board looks to be defaulting TZ w/ DST with no config options
<nate>  mcintosh: Did you guys modify the theme? Check your language/en_US/common.php file, make sure the TZ declarations are set :P
<nate>  or is it language/en/common.php, I forget
<nate>  been a while since I messed with phpBB3
<nate>  mcintosh: nah I'm cool, I don't use the forum much lol
<nate>  also I guess I should be amused that a freenode netsplit just hung my client up worse than that 600~ privmsg spam net did lol
