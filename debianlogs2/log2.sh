<grawity>   only if you buy and install it yourself
<grawity>   the linode manager is free, but it doesn't actually manage the *insides* of a VPS
<grawity>   (other than perhaps showing graphs/statistics via Longview)
<grawity>   linode only provides the server itself, really
<grawity>   mostly just scheduled reboots for patching up Xen
<grawity>   (like https://status.linode.com/incidents/6lqznlfwlv1r)
<grawity>   can't remember any unplanned reboot
<grawity>   besides, new VPSes run on KVM anyways
<grawity>   you're chatting on it
<grawity>   well, I guess it's not technically official – they prefer tickets for that
<grawity>   but there *is* a bunch of Linode staff here
<grawity>   officially, it is
<grawity>   unless someone with a hat speaks ↑↑
