<cruxeternus>   I think you're right
<cruxeternus>   I'm showing a caker post at 2:28 PM
<cruxeternus>   It's 2:21 ET
<cruxeternus>   Maybe caker is just ahead of us
<cruxeternus>   DrJ: Your post shows 3:21 PM here.. I'm in CT
<cruxeternus>   Yes, but it's adjusting... incorrectly somehow
<cruxeternus>   The time apparently changes after a reload
<cruxeternus>   which is... odd
<cruxeternus>   Uh oh... here we go again...
<cruxeternus>   Oh, nm.... "It Came From Freenode" this time, apparently
<cruxeternus>   I have no entry from you in my buffer, dating back to yesterday.
<cruxeternus>   These are the only lines you've uttered in 24 hours... so whatever satisfies the requirement :P
